<TitleSection />

At <strong>Sureify</strong>, I built a responsive, flexible component library which lets designers drag-and-drop bespoke charts into their screens. Charts are one-to-one with nivo.rocks, vastly improving dev hand-off.

###### Advised by Arjan van der Vlies, Anders Houston, Patrick Schaenzel.

## A library by designers, for designers

Our design team needed a way to present data consistently throughout its product lineup. Up until this point, designers had been using placeholders, mocking up ad-hoc charts. But their unrefined nature made it hard to communicate to stakeholders, as they would get tripped up on the small details.

## Understanding my stakeholders

The first thing to get me on the right path was understanding who my stakeholders were, and what they needed.

### → Designers

As primary users, designers needed to be able to insert a chart in their design, and adjust it to their use-case. This meant the library needed to be:
- Intuitive <span className="text-tx-tertiary">(easy to use out-of-the-box)</span>
- Responsive <span className="text-tx-tertiary">(flex into different viewports)</span>
- Modifiable <span className="text-tx-tertiary">(sense of control over the tool)</span>

### → Developers

As secondary users, developers needed to be able to easily translate designs to code.

Discussions led us to nivo.rocks, an open-source React library for charts. This library serves as the foundation for the one in Figma.

## Breaking the limits of Figma

Figma, for all its strengths, is not exactly equipped for responsive data visualization.

The core problem: **layering**. Though auto-layout is powerful, it’s modeled after CSS flexbox—which fundamentally does not support layered elements. This means, to achieve responsiveness, I needed to find a way to combine auto-layout with constraints.

### Nailing the alignment

Even after figuring out a way to stack layers, how do you keep your data, grid, and labels aligned?

In a line/area chart, the grid extends to the edges of the container. This is because points don’t occupy horizontal space. Bar charts, on the otherhand, *do* fill up space—which means the grid needs to align itself by 

The solution I found was to force sub-components to maintain the same dimensions at all times. This can be done by putting them in a constrained noclip frame.

### Variants vs. direct-selection

There are three forms of modification to the chart components:

- **Direct selection**, where a user can select an element and modify it’s color, text content, etc.
- **Component controls**, which are primarily used to modify large structural changes (e.g. visible axes, number of bar segments, etc.).
- **Show/hide** a given element (e.g. number of bars, every other gridline, etc.).


### Naming conventions & documentation

With many different layers and sub-components in a chart, users need some way to differentiate between what they “can” and “cannot” touch.

- **PascalCase** (capital letters) indicate a component that is intended to be editable.
- **kebab-case** (dashes) indicate components which should not be touched. These are the “under-the-hood changes”.

![screenshot of documentation](https://schultzdavidg-portfolio.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/dv/dv-docs.png)

Additionally, I wrote extensive documentation. It covered topics such as:

- **Component architecture;** components get complex, fast. I wrote two pages here: one outlining how to manipulate components, and one to guide further updates.
- **Visual encoding;** the first question when visualizing data is, what kind of chart should we use? To answer this, we should consider data types: amounts, proportions, distributions, xy relationships, etc.
- **Color theory;** is it more important that colors are pretty, or that they are informative? We settled on the latter, emphasizing the use of sequential, categorical, and diverging data sets.
- **Dev hand-off;** how does a chart go from conceptualization to production? As this question is relevant to designer, developer, and product stakeholders, this page is written to address each perspective.



### Presets make it easy

For most use-cases, a user doesn’t need full control over the shape of their data. By establishing presets for: the shape of data; labels + styles; date ranges + density—I could hide complexity under-the-hood—decreasing cognitive overload.

## Things I'd do differently

I’m very proud of the system I developed. I was a junior at this time, and this project forced me to progress my technical skillset through a lot of trial and error.

But there are a few things I’d do differently, and they all coalesce around focusing my time into things that actually matter.

The responsiveness and flexibility I achieved was met with a lot of positive reception, but in practice I observed that designers would often just... break the component, and apply changes manually. They didn’t need all the bells and whistles I provided! They just needed a foundational structure.

So this project set the groundwork for two important skills: resilience and creativity towards technical problems, and a stronger appreciation for how I align my energy with what my team needs.
