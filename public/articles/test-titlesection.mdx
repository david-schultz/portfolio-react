<TitleSection />

# Welcome to the TitleSection Demo!

This article demonstrates how the `<TitleSection>` component automatically reads the frontmatter and displays the title, subtitle, date, and location without requiring any props.

The component above should have automatically populated with:
- **Title**: Test Article with TitleSection
- **Subtitle**: Demonstrating the new TitleSection component
- **Date**: August 2025 (using the `published` field)
- **Location**: Seattle, WA

## How it works

The `<TitleSection>` component uses React Context to access the frontmatter data that was parsed by gray-matter during the MDX rendering process. This allows authors to simply insert `<TitleSection />` anywhere in their MDX files without passing any props.

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** The TitleSection component is now working with your existing gray-matter setup!
</Callout>

## Frontmatter Support

The component supports the following frontmatter fields:
- `title` - Main title of the article
- `subtitle` - Subtitle or description
- `published` / `date` / `year` - Publication date (uses whichever is available)
- `location` - Geographic location or context

The component gracefully handles missing fields - if a field isn't present in the frontmatter, it simply won't display that part of the component.
