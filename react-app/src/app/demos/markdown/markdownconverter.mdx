# Markdown Converter
##### 2025 ※ AI demo

This is an introductory attempt to using AI to convert handwritten notes into .md files. This is intended to bridge the gap between tangible note-taking and the practicality of obsidian.md.


### Sandbox
Insert converter component


### Roadmap
Version 1.0 will use image upload + AI conversion. Version 2.0 will likely use tldraw; to use vector input instead. Version 3.0 will attempt to implement OCR (possibly AI assisted?). At some point, we’ll explore custom syntax & live syntax.

While these details are ironed out in a webdev environment, the real meat will be implementing this in an iOS environment.
