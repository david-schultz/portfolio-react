## Exploring hand-centric geometry manipulation

Built with plywood and a laser cutter, this project "visceralizes" plant diversity in the Seattle Arboretum. It tracks two metrics in each grid cell: the number of plants, and the number of species. By looking at the ratio between these two metrics, observers can get a sense of where they'll find a greater diversity in plant life.

TerrariumXR was my capstone project at UW Design. From a design standpoint, it was an exploration into [[Dual-hand interaction|DHI]]. From my perspective, it was a project where I dived into Unity, and learned the technical side of building complex interactions in C#. It involved a *lot* of lessons about 3d geometry & performance. I grew quite familiar with Meta's XR Interaction SDK.

The basic idea was that you had a low-poly planet, whose geometry you could manipulate with your hands. In particular, DHI would let you change the geometry in different ways.

If you pinched one finger, it would allow you to pinch-and-pull vertices. With two fingers, you could manipulate edges; and with three, you could pull entire triangles. This meant I had to learn how to create geometry *in code* (rather than from game elements)—and had to write functions which analyzed hand gestures, movements, and positions which could *manipulate* that geometry. And lemme tell ya—it waas NOT easy. There were many features I hoped to move forward, but in the end I got it working :)

### Lessons
Now, if you were to *judge* the project, I'd definitely say it's a failure.
