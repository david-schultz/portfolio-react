# Welcome to MDX!

This is a test article to demonstrate our new **MDX** implementation while keeping gray-matter for frontmatter processing.

<Callout type="success">
ðŸŽ‰ **Great news!** MDX is now successfully integrated into your portfolio project!
</Callout>

## Features

MDX allows us to:

- Write Markdown content
- Include React components
- Use JSX directly in our content
- <Highlight color="blue">Highlight important text</Highlight>

## Code Example

Here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting("MDX"));
```

## Interactive Content

With MDX, we can now include interactive React components directly in our articles.

<Callout type="info">
**Pro tip**: You can create any React component and use it directly in your MDX files!
</Callout>

> This is a blockquote to test our custom styling.

## Custom Components

Try out these custom components:

- <Highlight>Default yellow highlight</Highlight>
- <Highlight color="green">Green highlight</Highlight>
- <Highlight color="red">Red highlight</Highlight>

<Callout type="warning">
**Note**: Remember that gray-matter still handles all frontmatter processing, so your existing workflow remains the same.
</Callout>

**Conclusion**: MDX is now successfully integrated into the project while maintaining gray-matter compatibility!
