          <p>How do you represent time in three dimensions? One option is to lay it out as a timeline in front of you.</p>
          <p>Cut off the ends, throw on some events, and call it a day.
We gave it a shot, but decided that this iteration didn&apos;t work for two main reasons; for one, a calendar doesn&apos;t need to occupy a user&apos;s full &quot;viewport&quot;. It&apos;s probably better suited to the peripheral.</p>
          <p>Second, and more fundamentally, this linear form factor didn&apos;t feel &quot;anchored.&quot; It didn&apos;t give you a sense of where you were in your day.</p>

          <p>What if, instead, we modeled it after a clock? This way, the user would always be able to relate the current time to the current cycle.</p>
          <p>We ended up really digging this idea, and coming up with a few tricks to work within the new constraints of a form that lacks a defined start/end.</p>

          <p>From the get-go, my team had been prototyping in ShapesXR on my teammate&apos;s Quest 2. The controls took some getting used-to, and it was difficult to collaborate—but the power of working in an immersive environment was immediately apparent.</p>
          <p>Thinking long-term, I noticed two major problems:</p>
          <ol className="styled text-md mb-4">
            <li>We needed to be able to record passthrough, which isn&apos;t possible on Quest 2.</li>
            <li>ShapesXR&apos;s limited interaction capabilities were becoming a obstacle for ideation.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>With a clear need, and a strong desire to explore XR, I pulled the trigger and saddled up to learn Unity.</p>
